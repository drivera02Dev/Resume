# Career Objective

I am currently seeking to further my experience that supports my specialized academic background that I have gained here at Iowa State. 
I am specilizing in Electromagnetic Fields, Antennas, and wave propagation.
I also have a strong foundation in signals and systems as well. 
Starting an entry level career in that field would definitley help further my goals.
